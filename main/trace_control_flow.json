"{\n    \"exists\": true,\n    \"score\": 9,\n    \"reason\": \"The vulnerability chain exists and is highly exploitable due to unfiltered and unvalidated user input reaching a sensitive sink function. The user input is directly used in a command execution without any sanitization or validation steps. The use of `trace_control_flow` suggests that the input may be used to influence the control flow of the application, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.\"\n}"
